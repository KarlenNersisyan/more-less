      <span className="secondary">T</span>he origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term
      "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means
      'work'. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use
      of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word
      comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment,
      labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which
      means to work strenuously, toil). In English, people still occasionally
      use the words travail, which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester
      in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail
      both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called
      the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale). This
      link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel
      in modern times may or may not be much easier depending upon the
      destination. Travel to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme
      tourism, and adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel
      can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by
      bus, cruise ship, or even by bullock cart. Travel dates back to antiquity
      where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer
      homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.[9] While early
      travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade
      and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have
      tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.[10]
      Mankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus
      sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over
      10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century where
      aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight. Travel in
      the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, however, it was
      important to the economy and to society. The wholesale sector depended
      (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers,
      end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers
      wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (Wandering Monks) and
      wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas,
      traveling minstrels practiced the never-ending tour, and armies ranged far
      and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.[9] Pilgrimages were
      common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of
      travelers both locally (Canterbury Tales-style) and internationally. In
      the late 16th century it became fashionable for young European aristocrats
      and wealthy upper-class men to travel to significant European cities as
      part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the
      Grand Tour, it included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence,
      and Rome. However, The French Revolution brought with it the end of the
      Grand Tour. Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than
      land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways in the
      19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have
      started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was
      no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalized on by people
      like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were
      booked together. Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of
      long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the Second
      World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots. Indeed,
      air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman,
      Alexis Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.Travel may
      be local, regional, national (domestic) or international. In some
      countries, non-local internal travel may require an internal passport,
      while international travel typically requires a passport and visa. Tours
      are a common type of travel. Examples of travel tours are expedition
      cruises, small group tours, and river cruises.
